Your exceptional performance has not gone unnoticed.\n\nAs per protocol, you have been assigned your first command post. The coordinates of your homeworld have been transmitted to your navigation system. This planet will serve as the foundation for your future operations and contributions to our galactic civilization.\n\nThe Council has high expectations for your performance.\n\n[CLICK TO VIEW YOUR ASSIGNED HOMEWORLD]",

Share them with your crew! üç™\n\nPS: Your father says to remember the trick about reversing the polarity - whatever that means! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nLots of love and virtual hugs! ü§ó\nMom"

Remember when you accidentally activated the emergency evacuation system during naptime in Stellar Navigation 101? The look on Professor Zorblax's face when his hover-chair shot him straight into the ceiling... PRICELESS! üòÇ\n\nOr that time you tried to impress Sarah from Quantum Physics by \"improving\" the cafeteria's food replicator, and it spent a week producing nothing but purple spaghetti that tasted like rubber bands? Good times!\n\nBut seriously, despite all our shenanigans (like that infamous incident with the training simulator and the space hamster - which was totally YOUR fault, by the way), you've actually become a pretty decent commander. Who would've thought?\n\nCongrats on the promotion, you magnificent disaster! Try not to blow up your homeworld on the first day, okay?\n\nP.S. I still have that embarrassing hologram from the graduation party. You know, the one where you tried to demonstrate your \"perfect\" impression of an Andromedan space whale mating call? That's prime blackmail material right there! üòà\n\nYour partner in crime,\nJake\n\nP.P.S. But really, proud of you buddy! üéâ",
